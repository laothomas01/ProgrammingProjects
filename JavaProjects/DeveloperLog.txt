	I have completed a good portion of functionalities for my database classes.
	The problems I am facing is: 
	1) when a seat is created, they are stored in a hashmap. The issue here is seats with same information, but different keys can be added.
	2) I have not finished the GUI
	3) i have not converted my datetime information
	4) i still have to provide a remove function for my classes
	5) i have to parse my text file as well
	6) i have to do a for loop for my seats.

	I have completed the Userdatabase. Yay.
	I am looking at the SeatDatabase and going What the Fuck and I doing?
	-so it's a database for seats... but you cannot have duplicates of that seat
	-it takes in a seatID and a seat
	-this is the seat constructor: 
	
		this.seatPrice = seatPrice;
		this.seatNumber = seatNumber;
		this.isOccupied = isOccupied;
		this.seatSection = seatSection;
		this.date = date;
		this.time = time;
	I AM FUCKING CONFUSED.
